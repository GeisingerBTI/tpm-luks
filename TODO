TODO:

- implement a separate "NV" initramfs for all NV manipulation
 o create initramfs with all NV tools included
 o lock all new NV areas for write to this initramfs state (or Owner write)
 o write the operation to do on next reboot to a /boot/tpm-luks.conf, measure
   in tgrub
 o lock nvram for write to tpm-luks.conf state
 o when NV initramfs comes up, parse tpm-luks.conf, act accordingly, reboot

- Improve interface between nv-perms creation, grub.conf and tpm_luks

-- completed ---

o use 'grubby' for parsing grub.conf

plymouth-tpm/cryptroot-ask-tpm.sh:
o use a nv_info command to interrogate only relevant NV indexes to avoid
  DA logic
o include DA reset command
