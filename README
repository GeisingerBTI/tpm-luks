 tpm-luks is a set of scripts to help in storing a LUKS key in TPM NVRAM.
The primary goal of using these scripts is to lock your rootfs LUKS key into
the TPM such that the TPM will not release it unless you're running a trusted
kernel/initramfs combo.

 The assumptions made by this package are:

 You've checked the "encrypt" checkbox as part of the install for your fedora/
RHEL system, so the rootfs is encrypted. You can check if this is the case
using:

  blkdid -t TYPE=crypto_LUKS
